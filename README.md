# Tips
- /wordlist Use for decrypt the hashed text.
- You can add wordlist by add text file with wordlist and rename it to "w" with next number to the exist one, then put into /wordlist directory in the same path.
- XOR, OR, AND use the key as "utf-8".
- rot13, rot47; You can key "all" instead amount of rotation to see all rotation.
- You can key "name" to set or rename your name.
- Be polite with this program.
- Let's try.
